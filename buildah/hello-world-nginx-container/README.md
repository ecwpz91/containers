# Hello World! Nginx Container

A ["Hello, World!" program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"Hello,_World!"_program) is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program, and as such is often the very first program people write.

This is being served from a container running Nginx.
